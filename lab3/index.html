			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure</h1>
			<p>The challenge of this lab was to practice creating file structure and making index.html files !
					</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>It was pretty easy to do this lab. I had made my own index.html file on lab 2 with Mandy's help, so this was pretty easy breezy !</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Not many problems arose, especially since Wes led us through the first step of this project in lecture on Thurday ! I had a little problem linking my image to this webpage but I figured it out! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This project went really well! A part of me wishes we didn't procrastinate so much, lol.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here is the screenshot of my code!</p>
